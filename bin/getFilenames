#                file which contains a single ID for each file on
#                each line, such as:
#		Ano1001a
#		Ano1001b
#		Ano1001c
#		Ano1001d
#		Ano1001e
#		Ano1002
#		Ano1025a
#		Ano1025b
#		Ano1025c
#		Ano1025d
#                 This is copyied from the spreadsheet
#                 https://bit.ly/jrp-metadata, column A and stored
#                 into a file call jrp-scores/ids.txt Then the output
#                 of this program is pasted into the "Filename"
#                 column of the same spreadsheet.
